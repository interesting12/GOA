## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid Template
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was a hard one. The Bento box layout for the desktop version is a pain to set up unless you know about the grid template functionality, especially because the order of the cards changes between the designs. I'm sure there's a way to do this without using that option but I could not find one that worked. Other than that, there is also the problem of images that overflow in a specific direction which took me a while. I learned a lot about flex and grid layouts through this challenge.
