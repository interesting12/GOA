    <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for specifying the presentation and styling of a document <br>
        written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).[1] CSS is<br>
         a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]<br>

        CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3]<br>
         This separation can improve content accessibility;[further explanation needed] provide more flexibility and <br>
         control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting<br>
          by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; <br>
          and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.<br>
          
        Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different<br>
        rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based <br>
        tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.[4]<br>
        
        The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which declaration applies if more than one<br>
         declaration of a property match a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.<br>
        
        The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME type) <br>
        text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS validation service<br>
         for CSS documents.[5]<br>
        
        In addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS including XHTML, plain XML, SVG, and XUL.<br>
         CSS is also used in the GTK widget toolkit.</p>
