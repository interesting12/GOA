    <p>HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. <br> 
        It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets<br>  
        (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.<br> 

        Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia<br> 
         web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.</p>
