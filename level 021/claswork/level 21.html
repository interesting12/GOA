            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>The Otto Flugmaschinenfabrik was founded in 1910 by Gustav Otto 
                in the Kingdom of Bavaria, which was a state of the German Empire.
                The firm was reorganized on 7 March 1916 into Bayerische Flugzeugwerke AG. 
                This company was then renamed to Bayerische Motoren Werke (BMW) in 1922. 
                However, the name BMW dates back to 1913, when a company to use the name was 
                founded by Karl Rapp initially as Rapp Motorenwerke. The name and Rapp Motorenwerke's
                engine-production assets were transferred to Bayerische Flugzeugwerke in 1922, who adopted
                the name the same year.[6] BMW's first product was produced for fighter aircraft of the 
                Luftstreitkräfte. It was a straight-six aircraft engine called the BMW IIIa, designed in 
                the spring of 1917 by engineer Max Friz. Following the end of World War I, BMW remained in
                business by producing motorcycle engines, agricultural equipment, household items, and railway brakes.
                The company produced its first motorcycle, the BMW R 32, in 1923.</p>

                    <h3>21th Century</h3>
                    <p>In January 2021, BMW announced that its sales in 2020 fell by 8.4 percent due to the impact of COVID-19 pandemic restrictions. However, in the fourth quarter of 2020, BMW witnessed a rise of 3.2% in its customers' demands.[14]
        
                        On 18 January 2022 BMW announced a BMW 7 Series (G11) special edition simply called "The Final V12",[15] the last BMW series production vehicle to be fitted with a V-12 engine.[15]
                        
                        On 5 October 2023 it was announced that BMW UK CEO Chris Brownridge would succeed Torsten Müller-Ötvös as the CEO of Rolls-Royce starting 1 December 2023, as a result of Müller-Ötvös retiring.[16]</p>

                    <h2>Slogan</h2>
                    <p>The slogan 'The Ultimate Driving Machine' was first used in North America in 1974.[31][32] In 2010, <br>
                        this long-lived campaign was mostly supplanted by a campaign intended to make the brand more approachable <br>
                        and to better appeal to women, 'Joy'. By 2012 BMW had returned to 'The Ultimate Driving Machine'.[33]</p><br>
